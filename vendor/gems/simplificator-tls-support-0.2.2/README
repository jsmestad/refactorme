= where does it come from ?

We did not write this code. We just gem-ified it!

We could not find out who's the original author of this piece of code.
Looks like everyone copied from everyone, pasted some code here and there and so on.
Here are some places where you can find this code (or similar)
 * http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/160724
 * http://brunomiranda.com/past/2007/11/5/in_need_of_an_smtp/
 * http://groups.google.co.jp/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/ab5b79feea255f5b
 * http://pastie.org/pastes/255293/edit

If you are the original author, please contact us so we can add proper credits (or remove the gem or ...)
